Asuna is [gluasteal](https://github.com/lewisclark/glua-steal) and [GMOD-SDK](https://github.com/Gaztoof/GMod-SDK) combined together, GMOD-SDK being as base and gluasteal as source for ScriptHook.

It works only on `x64` since `x86` is getting updates very lately and slowly, and it's just... feels outdated?

## Usage
- Compile `x64` in `Release` *(or download from [releases](https://github.com/shockpast/asuna-gmod/releases/latest))*
- Inject `asuna-gmod.dll` using any injector *([recommendation](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/))*
- Press `INSERT` to open the menu.
